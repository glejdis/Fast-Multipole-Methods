\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In the "Top Ten Algorithms of the 20th Century"
    \item Introduced by Greengard and Rokhlin 1987 for the N-body simulation problem
    \item E.g. star formation triggered by galaxy interactions in modified gravity
    \item $\rightarrow$ Problem: computational cost grows quadratically
    \item $\rightarrow$ Solution: FMM with linear complexity of O(N) operations
  \end{itemize}
