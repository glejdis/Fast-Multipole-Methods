\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}

The \gls{fmm} was first introduced by Greengard and Rokhlin in 1987 for the N-body simulation problem with pairwise interactions, such as elasticity, gravitation, electrostatics, or wave propagation \cite{Greengard1987AFA, Martinsson2015}.
N-body problems typically have a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ \cite{SicchaSeminar}.
The \gls{fmm} solves this problem by introducing an approximation of the driving force term, achieving linear complexity \cite{Martinsson2015}.
Moreover, the \gls{fmm} uses quad-trees or oct-trees to hierarchically split the computing domain and thus is frequently referred to as a ``tree code'' algorithm.
The tree structure makes this algorithm well-suited for multi-core and parallel computing systems \cite{Martinsson2015}.
This report first sheds some light on the inner workings of the FMM by providing in depth details on the steps of the algorithm and analyzing its time complexity.
Afterwards, the operators used by the algorithm are introduced and a rough analysis of the approximation error is given.
Lastly, details of the implementation of the rotating galaxy simulation are shown, as well as the obtained results.
After reading the report, the reader should comprehend the algorithmâ€™s underlying concepts and understand how the linear time complexity is achieved.

In this paper, we consider $N$ particles $p_i$ placed at positions $\vct x_i \in \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, where $\Omega$ is a rectangular domain.
For the ease of notation, we think of $\vct x_i$ as a point in the complex plane, where $\Re(\vct x)$ is the real part of $\vct x$.
Each of these particles induces a long-range potential $\Psi_i(\vct x) = m_i \log(\vct x - \vct x_i)$, where $m_i$ is the mass of the source particle $p_i$.
The aim is to obtain the net force $\vct f_j$ acting on the target particle $p_j$, which is the sum of all pairwise interactions \cite{short-course}:
\begin{equation}
  \vct f_j = \sum_{i=1, i\neq j}^N \vct F_{ij}(\vct x_i - \vct x_j, m_i m_j)
      = -\sum_{i=1, i\neq j}^N m_j \nabla \Re(\Psi_i(\vct x_j))
  \label{equ:force}
\end{equation}
